    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm a passionate developer starting my journey in web development. This portfolio represents the beginning of my career in technology, where I aim to create meaningful and impactful digital experiences.</p>
    
    <p>I have always been fascinated by how technology can solve real-world problems and connect people across the globe. My interest in programming began when I realized the power of code to transform ideas into reality.</p>
    
    <h3>My Skills and Interests</h3>
    <p>Currently, I'm learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a strong foundation in front-end development. I believe that understanding the fundamentals is crucial before moving on to more advanced frameworks and technologies.</p>
    
    <p>Beyond coding, I enjoy problem-solving and continuous learning. I spend time reading about new technologies, working on personal projects, and connecting with other developers in the community to expand my knowledge and skills.</p>
